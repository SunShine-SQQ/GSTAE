# GSTAE
Due to the relevant confidentiality agreement, the real factory data in the original paper cannot be disclosed to the public, so I generate random nonlinear data to run the code.
There are four files:
1、《Data generator.py》: Thirteen independent variables are randomly generated or combined, and y was obtained by nonlinear mapping from those variables;
2、《data.csv》: The data file which has been generated from 《Data generator》;
3、《GSTAE.py》：Main code file，can be run directly if《data.csv》is in the same file path;
4、《record》：Save the resullts。

△：The running environment of this code is: python 3.6.3，tensorflow 1.2.0，win 10-8G-64bit. The result may be slightly diffenrent in different environment, which is normal.
